# copper-arrowheads-to-copper-nuggets
This mods does exactly what it says, it turns copper arrowheads to copper nuggets using a hammer in a grid.

I made this because I noticed that I accumulated a few copper arrowheads by panning, but I don't really use arrows , but I didn't want that copper to go to waste. I also wanted to try adding recipes to the game and here we are.

I made this only for copper because that's where I'm at in the game. If there will be demand, I'll make it for other metals too
